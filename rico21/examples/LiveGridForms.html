<h1>Using Rico LiveGrid Forms</h1>

<p><a href='LiveGridForms_ja.html'><img src='client/images/japanese.gif' alt='View this page in Japanese'></a>

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>While this document just refers to ASP, identical functionality is provided
by the PHP and .net plugins.

<ol>
<li>create a new ASP file that includes ricoLiveGridForms.vbs

<li>in the new ASP, define each of the fields in the table to be edited - usually 1-3 lines of code per field

<li>the resulting ASP not only creates the appropriate grid, but also generates an input form in a hidden div

<li>the ASP also adds "add/edit/delete record" entries to the popup menu

<li>when add or edit is chosen, the form is unhidden (and filled in if edit was chosen)

<li>when the user hits the save button, the form silently posts back to the original ASP

<li>the ASP saves the data to the database and sends a response back to the client

<li>the client displays a success or failure message in the bookmark area
</ol>

<p>The following two diagrams shows how requests and responses flow with LiveGrid Forms pages,
and with LiveGrid pages without forms.
While the two diagrams are labelled ASP/PHP, they also apply to .net (except that there is no dbClass2 in .net).

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<p>This class provides all of the functions necessary to view, insert, update, and delete
records on a single table. An ASP script should follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Create a single instance of the class
<pre>set oForm=new TableEditClass</pre>

<li>call the SetTableName method
<pre>oForm.SetTableName "customer"</pre>

<li>optionally set the CanAdd, CanEdit, CanDelete, ConfirmDelete, and/or RecordName properties if desired
<pre>
oForm.options("canAdd")=CanAdd
oForm.options("canEdit")=CanModify
oForm.options("canDelete")=CanDelete
</pre>
<li>if TableName is a view or has no primary key defined, editing will be disabled
<li>call AddEntryField or AddCalculatedField for each field/column to be displayed
      Fields appear in both the table and form views, with the following exceptions:
<ul>
<li>entry type is H never gets sent to the client. Writes to the database get the defined default value.
<li>if FormView field property is set to "exclude", then the field appears in the table only.
<li>if FormView field property is set to "hidden", then the data is put in a hidden form field.
<li>Calculated fields appear in the table view only (same as FormView=exclude)
</ul>

<li>After each call to AddEntryField or AddCalculatedField, the other methods and properties
      can be invoked to control how the field is presented to the user (e.g. SortAsc).
      Calls to these properties/methods apply only to the field most recently added.
<li>call DisplayPage - this displays the grid or executes the database update
<pre>oForm.DisplayPage</pre>
</ol>


<h2>TABBED FORMS</h2>

<p>Forms with multiple panels/tabs are fully supported using the Rico.TabbedPanel class.
 Simply call AddPanel before calling AddEntryField to define the fields for that panel.
 For example:
<pre>
' these fields appear on the first panel
oForm.AddPanel "Panel #1"
oForm.AddEntryField "field1", "Field #1", "T", ""
oForm.AddEntryField "field2", "Field #2", "T", ""
oForm.AddEntryField "field3", "Field #3", "T", ""

' these fields appear on the second panel
oForm.AddPanel "Panel #2"
oForm.AddEntryField "field4", "Field #4", "T", ""
oForm.AddEntryField "field5", "Field #5", "T", ""
oForm.AddEntryField "field6", "Field #6", "T", ""
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, the panelIdx property can be set for each field as it is defined. In this
case, AddPanel can be called at any time prior to DisplayPage.
<pre>
' these fields appear on the first panel
oForm.AddEntryField "field1", "Field #1", "T", ""
oForm.CurrentField("panelIdx")=0
oForm.AddEntryField "field2", "Field #2", "T", ""
oForm.CurrentField("panelIdx")=0
oForm.AddEntryField "field3", "Field #3", "T", ""
oForm.CurrentField("panelIdx")=0

' these fields appear on the second panel
oForm.AddEntryField "field4", "Field #4", "T", ""
oForm.CurrentField("panelIdx")=1
oForm.AddEntryField "field5", "Field #5", "T", ""
oForm.CurrentField("panelIdx")=1
oForm.AddEntryField "field6", "Field #6", "T", ""
oForm.CurrentField("panelIdx")=1

oForm.AddPanel "Panel #1"
oForm.AddPanel "Panel #2"
</pre>

<h2>FIELD DEFINITION-METHODS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>AddEntryField (ColumnName, Heading, EntryTypeCode, DefaultValue)
<dd>Adds a new column to the grid and a new entry field to the popup form in ASP and PHP.
  <dl>

  <dt>ColumnName
  <dd>column name in the database table (does not support blanks or any name that would require square brackets in SQL, e.g.  [Apr 2005])

  <dt>Heading
  <dd>name that appears on the grid column's heading and also on the popup form

  <dt>EntryTypeCode
  <dd>string containing a code that controls how the column is displayed on the input form

    <ul>
    <li><strong>S</strong>:
    Display this column as a drop-down select list during data entry.
    Values may be specified using the "SelectValues" or "SelectSql" options.
    If neither is specified, then the values for the column are obtained using 
    a "select distinct" query.
    <li><strong>R</strong>: Same as "S", except the items are displayed using radio buttons.
    <li><strong>SL,RL</strong>: 
    Same as S & R, except that a lookup value is displayed in table view 
    (uses query specified by SelectSql).
    Typically used on columns that are foreign keys. SQL to get the display value 
    is specified using the "SelectSql" option.
    <li><strong>CL</strong>:  Same as "SL", except that the value is selected 
    using a custom control (such as the Rico Tree control).
    The SelectCtl option must be assigned the id of the custom control.
    <li><strong>N</strong>:
    Same as "S", but allows the user to create a new value.
    Typically used <em>without</em> the "SelectValues" or "SelectSql" options.
    <li><strong>H</strong>:   column is hidden from the user (DefaultValue will be stored in the table on adds and edits)
    <li><strong>D</strong>:   this is a date field (blanks allowed if column allows nulls)
    <li><strong>DT</strong>:  same as D, except that it also includes the time
    <li><strong>I</strong>:   integer number (blanks allowed if column allows nulls and required is false)
    <li><strong>F</strong>:   floating-point number (blanks allowed if column allows nulls and required is false)
    <li><strong>B</strong>:   non-blank text field (user gets a popup message in form view when clicking save and the field is empty)
    <li><strong>T</strong>:   standard text field (blanks allowed)
    <li><strong>TA</strong>:  text area field
    <li><strong>tinyMCE</strong>:  rich text edit field using the 
    <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">tinyMCE</a> library.
    </ul>

  <dt>DefaultValue
  <dd>column's default value in the form view
  </dl>

  <p>The equivalent to AddEntryField() in .net is to declare column fields as part of the markup.
  The "ColData" attribute contains the default value.
  Here is an example from ex2edit.aspx:
<pre>
&lt;Rico:Column runat='server' heading='Order#' width='60' 
             ColName='OrderID' EntryType='B' ColData='&lt;auto&gt;' /&gt;
</pre>

<dt>AddEntryFieldW (ColumnName, Heading, EntryTypeCode, DefaultValue, ColWidth)
<dd>Same as AddEntryField except an extra parameter is added for column width (in pixels).

<dt>AddCalculatedField (ColumnFormula, Heading)
<dd>ColumnFormula is any valid SQL expression or subquery.
    If the subquery needs to reference a column in the table being displayed,
    then the column name should be prefaced with the alias "t."
    Calculated fields will be displayed in table view, but not in form view.

<dt>AddFilterField (ColumnName, FilterValue)
<dd>Only display records where the contents of ColumnName=FilterValue.
    This becomes a hidden field (entry type H).

<dt><a name='ConfirmDeleteCol'></a>ConfirmDeleteCol
<dd>The contents of the most recently added column will be included in delete confirmation messages

<dt>SortAsc
<dd>In table view, sort by this column in ascending order (applies to most recently added field)

<dt>SortDesc
<dd>In table view, sort by this column in descending order (applies to most recently added field)

</dl>


<h2>FIELD DEFINITION-PROPERTIES</h2>

<p>All <a href="LiveGrid.html#column">LiveGrid</a> column properties are supported, in addition to these which are specific to LiveGrid Forms.

<dl>

<dt>AddQuotes
<dd>When false, the column value will be left unquoted when inserting or updating 
    the database (default=true). This makes it possible to populate columns with 
    SQL function calls. For example:
<pre>
oForm.AddEntryField "LastEditUser","","H","suser_sname()"
oForm.CurrentField("AddQuotes")=false
oForm.AddEntryField "LastEditDate","","H","getdate()"
oForm.CurrentField("AddQuotes")=false
</pre>

<dt>required
<dd>Boolean value that specifies whether the input field may be left empty 
(default: false if column allows nulls and EntryType is not "B", true otherwise).
  
<dt><a name='AltTable'></a>AltTable (TabId)
<dd>Specifies that the field should be stored in an alternate table
    TabId should be the value returned by a previous call to <a href='#DefineAltTable'>DefineAltTable</a>

<dt>TxtAreaRows
<dd>For columns with entry type "TA", this is # of rows to display in the 
    textarea when in form view (default 4)

<dt>TxtAreaCols
<dd>For columns with entry type "TA", this is # of columns to display in the 
    textarea when in form view (default 80)

<dt>FilterFlag
<dd>If true, then the grid is filtered by the default value for this column (default=false)

<dt>Help
<dd>Creates a title tag containing the specified text (form view only). So if the user
hovers over the field label, they will see this text as balloon help. For example:
<pre>
oForm.CurrentField("Help")="Date must be entered in mm/dd/yyyy format"
</pre>

<dt>pattern
<dd>A string containing a regular expression. User entries will be checked to ensure
they match the pattern specified. There are a few special values:
<ul>
<li>"email" - tests for a valid email address
<li>"float-unsigned" - tests for a valid unsigned floating point (real) number
<li>"float-signed" - tests for a valid signed floating point (real) number (this is the default when EntryType is "F")
<li>"int-unsigned" - tests for a valid unsigned integer number
<li>"int-signed" - tests for a valid signed integer number (this is the default when EntryType is "I")
</ul>
<br>It is recommended that a Help entry be included
whenever a pattern is specified. If the field fails validation, the help text
will be included in the error message presented to the user. For example:
<pre>
oForm.CurrentField("Help")="Enter date as mm/dd/yyyy"
oForm.CurrentField("pattern")="^\\d{1,2}/\\d{1,2}/\\d{4}$"
</pre>

<dt>min/max
<dd>Specifies the minimum/maximum allowable values for fields with EntryType "I", "F", and "D". 
For example:
<pre>
oForm.AddEntryField "field1", "Field #1", "I", "0"
oForm.CurrentField("min")=1
oForm.CurrentField("max")=10
oForm.CurrentField("Help")="Enter a value between 1 and 10"

oForm.AddEntryField "field2", "Field #2", "D", Date()
oForm.CurrentField("min")="2000-01-01"
oForm.CurrentField("max")="2099-12-31"
oForm.CurrentField("Help")="Enter a value in the 21st century!"
</pre>

<dt>InsertOnly
<dd>Only write this field to the database when peforming an insert (default=false).
<pre>
oForm.AddEntryField "CreateDate","","H","getdate()"
oForm.CurrentField("AddQuotes")=false
oForm.CurrentField("InsertOnly")=true
</pre>

<dt>UpdateOnly
<dd>Only write this field to the database when peforming an update (default=false).
<pre>
oForm.CurrentField("UpdateOnly")=true
</pre>

<dt>ReadOnly
<dd>If true, data is displayed on the entry form but cannot be changed, text is gray (default=false).
Does not apply to entry types of S, SL, N, R, RL -- use objTE.CurrentField("FormView")="hidden" instead.

<dt>SelectValues
<dd>Specifies the choices the user sees in form view for EntryTypes of N, S, and R.
    If supplied, then this should be a string of comma-separated values. For example:
<pre>
oForm.CurrentField("SelectValues")="Y,N"
</pre>

<dt>SelectSql
<dd>Specifies the SQL select statement to use for EntryTypes of SL, CL, and RL.
    The select statement should return 2 columns: the first being the code 
    and the second being the text value/description. For example:
<pre>
oForm.CurrentField("SelectSql")="select ID,Name from Customers"
</pre>

<dt>SelectFilter
<dd>SelectSql serves 2 purposes. First, it is used to retrieve the appropriate
    data to display in the grid. Second, it is used to populate the values in
    the select box (SL) or radio buttons (RL) on the pop-up form. In some cases,
    you may want these to be different. In the SelectSql example above, we
    are retrieving customer name. But let's say that our Customers table has
    a "CreditHold" field and we want to disable the selection of customers on
    credit hold in the form view, but still display them in the grid.
    This is where SelectFilter comes in:
<pre>
oForm.CurrentField("SelectFilter")="CreditHold='NO'"
</pre>
