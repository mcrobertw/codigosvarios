<h1>Rico Grids</h1>

<p><a href='grids_ja.html'><img src='client/images/japanese.gif' alt='View this page in Japanese'></a>

<p>The Rico library supports 2 different types of grids: 
<strong>LiveGrid</strong> and <strong>SimpleGrid</strong>. 
LiveGrid data is always buffered in a 2-dimensional JavaScript array. As the user scrolls
vertically through the grid, data is dynamically copied from the array onto the grid.
SimpleGrids on the other hand are unbuffered -- all data for the grid exists in the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>, not
in a JavaScript data structure.

<p>Both types of grids share some common features, including:
<ul>
<li>column headings that stay fixed and don't scroll off the top of the screen
<li>frozen columns on the left side of the grid
<li>resizable columns
<li>common css styling - styles developed for LiveGrids also work for SimpleGrids and vice versa
<li>compatibility with languages that read right-to-left (rtl) - 
<a href="asp/rtl/ex1.asp">ASP</a> &amp; <a href="php/rtl/ex1.php">PHP</a> examples are included
<li>compatibility with Rico pop-up (context) menus
</ul>

<h2>LiveGrid</h2>
<p>Rico provides lots of support for loading a LiveGrid buffer. The buffer can can be loaded from:
<ul>
<li>a SQL database query
<li>an XML file
<li>an HTML table
<li>a javascript array
</ul>

<h3>Connecting LiveGrid to a database</h3>
<p>To simplify the task of loading a LiveGrid with SQL query results, Rico comes with a set of "plug-ins" which
connect your database to your LiveGrid. Rico plug-ins have been tested with the following
databases:

<p><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4' class='compat' style='margin-bottom:0px'>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>MySQL</th>
<th>Oracle</th>
<th>DB2</th>
<th>SQL Server</th>
<th>MS Access</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>PHP</th>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ASP</th>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<th>.net</th>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
<td><img src='client/images/checkmark.gif' alt='checkmark'></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style='font-size:8pt; margin:0px;'>Rico plug-in/database compatibility as of Nov 2007
<br>
<br>* The ASP plug-in uses ADO and the .net plug-in uses ADO.net,
<br>and thus should be able to connect with any data source that is compatible with ADO</p>

<p>LiveGrid uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a> 
technology so that only a portion of the SQL query result is
sent to the client at a time. As the user scrolls the grid, the JavaScript code determines
which portion of the query results are required and sends an AJAX request back to the plug-in.
The plug-in retrieves those results from the database and returns them back to the client.
So whether your query returns 10 rows or 100,000 rows, LiveGrid can display the results
quickly and easily with an intuitive user interface.

<p>Finally, if your users are allowed to make changes to the data, the Rico plug-ins 
make that easy too. Just define your grid using <strong>LiveGrid Forms</strong> -- 
Add, Edit, and Delete record
selections will be added to the grid's context (popup) menu. 

<ul>
<li>When Add or Edit is selected, a popup
form will be presented to the user. 
<li>When the user "saves" the form, the data is posted back
to the original script, which writes the results back to the database. 
</ul>

<p>If it sounds complicated, don't worry! All of this work is handled by the plug-in. 
See the "ex2edit" example
for a demonstration of how easy it is, both for the user and the programmer.
"ex4edit" demonstrates how to make multiple grids on a page editable.

<h3>Populating LiveGrid with XML</h3>

<p>While plug-ins make it easy to load data into a LiveGrid, they are not required.
A LiveGrid buffer can be loaded with XML data from any source, as long as the data follows this format:

<pre>
&lt;ajax-response&gt;
&lt;response type='object' id='MyGridId_updater'&gt;
&lt;rows update_ui='true' offset='0'&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Data for row 1, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Data for row 1, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Data for row 2, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Data for row 2, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/rows&gt;
&lt;/response&gt;
&lt;/ajax-response&gt;
</pre>

<p>See the weather and photo examples, which retrieve data from Yahoo Weather and Flickr respectively and reformat the data
into the structure shown above. These examples are currently available in PHP and .net versions, but not ASP.

<h3>Populating LiveGrid with data from an HTML table</h3>

<p>A LiveGrid can also be easily created on a web page that contains a traditional HTML table.
Just assign an id to the table and pass that id in during LiveGrid initialization. Headings
will be taken from the table's thead section and data from the tbody. No AJAX is
performed in this case, but the data is still buffered in a JavaScript array. Several
examples are included in the Rico distribution, look for the ones marked "LiveGrid-Static Buffer"</p>

<hr>
<h2>SimpleGrid</h2>

<p>SimpleGrid's are new to Rico 2.0 and share some of the same functionality as LiveGrids - 
resizable columns, frozen columns, and frozen headings. 
However, unlike a LiveGrid, the data is static and resides in the DOM -
so no buffering, no AJAX refreshes, no sorting, no filtering.
Why would you use a SimpleGrid? 
<ol>
<li>Because it is more flexible in what each cell can contain - 
cells in a column do not all have to be of the same type.
<li>In some circumstances, it can perform better on the client than LiveGrid; 
particularly on a slow client displaying a grid with many columns.
<li>Finally, a SimpleGrid can contain input elements (checkboxes, select lists, etc). 
While a LiveGrid can also contain input elements, because the element values are stored in the
LiveGrid buffer, submitting the values back to the server can be tricky.
SimpleGrids do not suffer from this problem. You can simply surround the
entire grid with standard &lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt; tags and any
input elements within the grid will be submitted back to the server.
</ol>

<p>The most sophisticated example of a SimpleGrid is the spreadsheet
included with this distribution. You can enter formulas and it will
recalculate when you change the inputs - just like a commercial spreadsheet.
A link to the spreadsheet example can be found under the "HTML Examples" section
of the examples menu.
When in the spreadsheet, click the <img alt="help" style="vertical-align:top;" src="client/images/sheet/help.gif"> button to see all it can do.

<p>SimpleGrids can be created either of two ways:
<ul>
<li>By using one of the SimpleGrid plug-ins. Plug-ins exist for PHP, ASP, and .net.
<li>By using XSLT. Rico includes an XSL file that will convert a standard
HTML table to a SimpleGrid.
</ul>

<h3>Creating a SimpleGrid by using a plug-in</h3>

<p>Each plug-in defines a SimpleGrid class. Within the class, there are methods
to start header rows and data rows - just call one of these methods everywhere
you would put a &lt;tr&gt; tag in an HTML table. There is also a method to
create a cell - just call it everywhere
you would put a &lt;th&gt; or &lt;td&gt; tag in an HTML table.
When you are done defining the table content, just call the render method
(except in the .net plugin where render is called automatically).
It's that easy!

<h3>Creating a SimpleGrid by using XSLT</h3>

<p>If your web page is XHTML compliant, then there is another way to generate a SimpleGrid.
Just use the XSL stylesheet "ricoSimpleGrid.xsl" to transform tables in your page
to SimpleGrids. The stylesheet looks for tables with a class name of "ricoSimpleGrid" 
and then does the transformation for you. At one time, Rico supported doing this
transformation on the client. However, due to changes in the Prototype library, this
is no longer possible. Therefore, if you choose to use this approach, the XSLT transform
must be performed on the server.
