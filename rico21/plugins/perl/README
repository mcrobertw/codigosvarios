README FOR DBIx::LiveGrid
=========================

This module provides a link between an AJAX LiveGrid (a dynamically scrollable database table within a web page) and DBI (Perl's database interface).  With a half dozen lines of perl script and a short HTML section, you can create web windows into any DBI accessible database.

==============
PRE-REQUISITES
==============

You will need these Perl modules.  They are available from any
CPAN mirror:

 * DBI
 * SQL::Abstract
 * SQL::Abstract::Limit

Note: It's possible to run without the SQL::* modules, but you'll need to construct your own request validator and SQL generator.

You will need a web-server such as Apache (or any other web server
capable of serving CGI scripts and/or mod_perl scripts).

===================
=head1 INSTALLATION
===================

1. Install the pre-requisites (see above)

2. Install DBIx-LiveGrid

a. Download the latest version of DBIX-LiveGrid from a CPAN mirror,
   for example:

 http://cpan.org/authors/id/J/JZ/JZUCKER/DBIx-LiveGrid-0.01.tar.gz

b. Unpack and untar the tarball, and change into the LiveGrid directory.

c. Install the module using these commands:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

You can also use nmake, dmake, etc., instead of make.

3. Copy the Examples directory and its sudirectories into someplace in your
web documents tree.  You should end up with a structure something 
like this:

  /your_http_root/your_path/Examples/livegrid.html
  /your_http_root/your_path/Examples/cgi-bin/livegrid.cgi
  /your_http_root/your_path/Examples/css/dbix-livegrid.css
  /your_http_root/your_path/Examples/images/sort_asc.gif
  /your_http_root/your_path/Examples/images/sort_desc.gif
  /your_http_root/your_path/Examples/scripts/dbix-livegrid.js

If you wish, you can rename the Examples directory after moving it.  The dbix-livegrid.js is required and must be available to your web server.  The others are optional add-ons or examples.

4. Download these two files into the scripts directory created in the step above.
